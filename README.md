project3-happy-hour
===================
This app was created while attending the Web Development Immersive program at General Assembly.  I forked this from the original repository located at https://github.com/ktk10191/project3-happy-hour and have since made some updates.

Our core project team consisted of [Kyle Knott](https://github.com/ktk10191), [Cosimo Barbato](https://github.com/cbarb001), [Sophana Sok](https://github.com/SophanaSok), and myself.  We built this app over the course of three weeks as part of our project 3.  The core project requirements were:

- Rails 4 + PostgreSQL
- Create an API
- Consume that API (with Handlebars, AngularJS, Google Maps, D3, etc.)
- Log real user stories in Pivotal Tracker
- Track progress in Pivotal Tracker
- Manage team contributions on GitHub
- At least 16 model specs (across any # of models) and 8 controller specs (across any # of controllers, but at least 4 actions covered)
