project3-happy-hour
===================
This app was created while attending the Web Development Immersive program at General Assembly.  I forked this from the original repository located at https://github.com/ktk10191/project3-happy-hour and have since made some updates.

Our core project team consisted of [Kyle Knott](https://github.com/ktk10191), [Cosimo Barbato](https://github.com/cbarb001), [Sophana Sok](https://github.com/SophanaSok), and myself.  We built this app over the course of three weeks as part of our project 3.

The app currently displays seeded bar data but you can add new bar information as a user.
